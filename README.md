# cisco_projects

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project,  a series of network scenarios with Cisco Packet Tracer is presented, which cover a wide range of networking concepts. These scenarios encompass everything from fundamental network connections to the design of resilient and secure networks. The project was done as a part of my accelerated cyber security training at the Fields Institute - University of Toronto.
